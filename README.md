This is a snippet of a crowdfunding website.
I created it using react js. to practice using props, usestate and conditional rendering.
All the buttons available on the website work.
I will improve on ensuring that the figures change in the future with donations made by the user.
The project inspiration was attained from frontent mentor but the coding is all mine.
below are pictures of how the project tured out.
